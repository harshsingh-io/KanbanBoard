## 2024-05-23 - [Accessibility String Naming]
**Learning:** Using generic string names like 'app_logo' for content descriptions can lead to poor accessibility if they are reused in contexts where they don't make sense or if the value is generic.
**Action:** Use 'cd_' prefix for accessibility content descriptions to clearly separate them from display text and encourage descriptive values.
